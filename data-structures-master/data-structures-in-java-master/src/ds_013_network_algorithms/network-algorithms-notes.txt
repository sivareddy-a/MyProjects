TERMINOLOGY
***********
Network / Graph         A set of nodes connected by links
Node / Vertex           A spot in a network
Link / Edge             Connects nodes, can be either directed or indirected
Path                    A sequence of nodes and links
Cycle / Loop            A path that returns to its starting point
Reachable               B is reachable from A if there is a path from A to B
Connected               Nodes A and B are connected if B is reachable from A and vice versa
Undirected              A graph is connected if every node is connected to every other node
Strongly Connected      If every node in a graph is reachable from every other node
Weakly Connected        A directed network becomes connected when you replace its links with undirected links
Adjacent                Nodes are connected by a link
Neighbor                An adjacent node

Example;

A ---- 75 ----> B

Node A and Node B are connected by a link so they are adjacent nodes.
Node B is Node A's neighbor because there is a directed link from Node A
to Node B however, Node A is not neighbor of Node B because there is not a
backward directed link from Node B to Node A. If the graph was undirected,
then both Nodes would be neighbors of each other.

Degree                 In an undirected network, he number of links a node has is called Degree.
In-Degree              In a directed network, the number of links entering a node is called In-Degree.
Out-Degree             Same as In-Degree but Out-Degree is the number of links leaving the node.


NETWORK REPRESENTATION
**********************
You can save network in a text file in order to reuse it. Check out following directed graph;

      A
     / \
    /   \
  10     15
  /        \
|/_        _\|

B --- 12 --> C
 \          /
  \        /
  16     13
    \   /
    _\|/_
      D

To save it to a text file, you can use following format;

nodeLabel, toNode#1, cost#1, toNode#2, cost#2,... toNode#N, cost#N

So, the text representation will be as follows;

A, B, 10, C, 15
B, C, 12, D, 16
C, D, 13
D
